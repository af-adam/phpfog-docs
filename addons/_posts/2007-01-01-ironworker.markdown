### Install IronWorker

In the "Add-ons" tab in your app console click "Install" for the IronWorker add-on. That's it!

### Integrate IronWorker

Just copy [IronWorker.class.php](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_php/blob/master/IronWorker.class.php) and include it in your script:

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
	require_once "IronWorker.class.php

### Create a Worker

When you install IronWorker, the installer creates two environment variables set with the necessary credentials. Create a worker and pass in those credentials like this:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums:3 linenums">
$worker = new IronWorker(array(
'token' => getenv('IRON_WORKER_TOKEN'),
'project_id' => getenv('IRON_WORKER_PROJECT_ID')
));</pre>

Here's an example worker:

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
	echo "Hello PHP World!\n";

We'll call this worker "HelloWorld.php".

### Upload Your Worker

Here's how to take the example above, zip it up, and upload it to IronWorker.

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
	# Zip single file:
	IronWorker::createZip(dirname(__FILE__), array('HelloWorld.php'), 'worker.zip', true);
	$res = $iw->postCode('HelloWorld.php', 'worker.zip', 'HelloWorld');

###  Queue Your Worker

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
	$task_id = $iw->postTask('HelloWorld');

Your worker should start in a few seconds.

### Schedule Your Worker

If you want to run your code more than once or run it in regular intervals, you can schedule it:

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
	# 3 minutes from now
	$start_at = time() + 3*60;

	# Run task every 2 minutes, repeat 10 times
	$iw->postScheduleAdvanced('HelloWorld', array(), $start_at, 2*60, null, 10);

### Check the Status of Your Worker

Use the `getTaskDetails()` method.

{: .prettyprint .linenums}
	<?php
	$task_id = $iw->postTask('HelloWorld');
	$details = $iw->getTaskDetails($task_id);

	echo $details->status; # prints 'queued', 'complete', 'error' etc.

### Connect Your Worker to Your PHP Fog App's Database {#database}

PHP Fog doesn't allow remote connections to your app's database, but we've made a special provision for IronWorker workers. Here are the settings you'll need for that: 

	Host: mysql-proxy.phpfog.com

The port you should use depends on which particular database your app is connected to. You can check which database you're connected to by going to your PHP Fog app console. Click on the "Env. Variables" tab and check the value of the variable called "`MYSQL_DB_HOST`".

`db01.phpfog.com`

	Port: 3306

`mysql-shared-02.phpfog.com`:
	
	Port: 3307

### And More...

You can also pass payloads to your tasks, set progress status, logs, etc. For more information, check out some of these resources:

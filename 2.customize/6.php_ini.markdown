PHP Fog does not support direct access to php.ini. However, the `AllowOverride` directive in php.ini is set to "`All`" which enables you to set the values of the directives in your .htaccess or in your PHP file via `ini_set()`.

### Setting Values `.htaccess`

Setting the value of a directive in `.htaccess` is easy. Simply place the following line of code in your `.htaccess` file, and insert the name and value of the directive you want to use:

	php_value *name value*

### Setting Values Using `ini_set()`

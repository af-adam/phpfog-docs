All applications by default have only read access to the files and folders in your application.

To make a folder or file writable, use the "Permission" tab in the App console to specific the paths of the filers/folders which are to be writable.

Note: Git doesn't create folders if they are empty, and therefore changing permissions will not work. First you follow the instructions in "How do I create a folder in git?." After you complete this you can use the permissions tool to make it writable as needed.

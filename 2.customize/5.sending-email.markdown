PHP Fog supports PHP's mail() method. Each dedicated instance has an SMTP server so you can send email just as you would from any PHP application. The server can send around 35 emails per second. 

This method is not, however, the best method for sending email because it doesn't provide the greatest reliability, throughput, or visibility.

Fortunately, we have great third party addons and services that are simple to set up and operate, address all of mail()'s shortcomings, and provide robust additional functionality:

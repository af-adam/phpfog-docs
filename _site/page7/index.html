	<h3>Torture</h3><date datetime="Sun Apr 26 00:00:00 -0700 2009">April 26, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">I&rsquo;ve been following the torture stuff moderately closely. For people who haven&rsquo;t been, the main arguments seem to boil down to: Is waterboarding (and other techniques authorized in the recently released legal memos) torture? Did it save lives? Should the people who conducted it be prosecuted? Should the people who authorized it be prosecuted? On the first question, I feel like Christopher Hitchens&rsquo; take on it, after subjecting himself to the experience, is pretty compelling. So is John McCain&rsquo;s: Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure. It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and...</p>

	<h3>Twitter</h3><date datetime="Thu Mar 19 00:00:00 -0700 2009">March 19, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">I&rsquo;ve been on twitter for a few months now, but I have to admit, I wasn&rsquo;t really getting it until I read this. I mean, there are clearly many ways to use twitter, including the reason that twitter gives you: to broadcast your current status. But I, like many, don&rsquo;t really feel the need to tell people when I&rsquo;m pooping, and also don&rsquo;t feel the need to know when others are pooping. I think this is why many people dismiss twitter, like I did until recently. But, in the exchange linked to above, something really familiar happens: someone overhears a...</p>

	<h3>Persistent Online Identity</h3><date datetime="Tue Feb 10 00:00:00 -0800 2009">February 10, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">OpenID, OpenSocial, Disqus all seem to point to the inevitability of persistent online identities. I imagine this POLID as something that will follow you from site to site, and be easily aggregable into a lifestream or personal history of web interactions. This probably raises privacy concerns, but (Chabo and I have agreed) privacy is obsolete. Privacy is only going to become increasingly difficult to maintain, and it runs counter to transparency. I think transparency is good and the real way to deal with issues that privacy concerns seek to address is to combine more transparency with tolerance of deviant but...</p>

	<h3>Convergence, or All The Things I've Been Thinking About That Turned Out To Be The Same Thing</h3><date datetime="Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 -0800 2008">December 30, 2008</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">So, I came pretty close to buying an iPhone because I found a deal for a refurbished 8GB 3G for $99. I ultimately decided not to after realizing that the cost of the device is really pretty trivial compared to the contractual commitment. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll cave soon or later, but I&rsquo;m going to try to wait until I have a real job and for there to be some more Android phones (I saw my first G1 in the wild a few days ago) on the market (which I think there will be a bunch more early in 2009, though...</p>

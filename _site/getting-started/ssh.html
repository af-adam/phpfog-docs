<p>This tutorial walks through generating an SSH key on Mac OS X, as well as getting source code access on PHP Fog. In order to access the source code for your application, you&rsquo;ll need to complete these steps.</p>

<p>This tutorial walks through generating an SSH key in Windows, as well as getting source code access on PHP Fog. In order to access the source code for your application, you&rsquo;ll need to complete these steps. It is assumed that you already installed the git client, if not here is a guide for installing on windows.
Open &ldquo;Git Bash&rdquo; (not the Windows command line), found in the start menu in the git folder.</p>

<h3 id="youll-need-to-make-sure-that-a-key-doesnt-already-exist">1. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure that a key doesn&rsquo;t already exist.</h3>

<p>cd ~/.ssh</p>

<p>If there&rsquo;s &ldquo;No Such File or Directory&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll need to create the folder, and move to the Generating a Key stage.
mkdir ~/.ssh
If there&rsquo;s a keypair already there, create a new folder called &lsquo;backup&rsquo; and move the public key and private key to that new folder.</p>

<h3 id="backup-and-remove-existing-ssh-keys">2. Backup and remove existing SSH keys</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to remove existing keys if they already exist.</p>

<p>ls</p>

<p>If there are no files name &ldquo;id_rsa&rdquo; or &ldquo;id_rsa&rdquo; go to the next. If they exist, you need to back them up and remove them from the old directory</p>

<p>mkdir key_backup
cp id_rsa* key_backup
rm id_rsa*</p>

<h3 id="generating-a-key">3. Generating a Key:</h3>
<p>In the Terminal window, generate a new keypair with this command:</p>

<p>ssh-keygen -t rsa</p>

<p>Terminal will start the key generation process.</p>

<p>Generating public/private rsa key pair.</p>

<h3 id="terminal-will-prompt-you-for-the-filename-to-save-the-key">4. Terminal will prompt you for the filename to save the key.</h3>

<p>Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/PHPFog/.ssh/id_rsa):</p>

<p>When asked about the directory, we recommend using the default directory &amp; name (id_rsa), unless you are an advanced user.
Note* the git tool (and others) look for the keys in this default directory, so not using the default directory may break the other tools
Hit &lsquo;enter&rsquo; for the default filename.</p>

<h3 id="youll-want-to-enter-a-passphrase-for-your-new-key">5. You&rsquo;ll want to enter a passphrase for your new key.</h3>
<p>Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
This password is used to protect the private key.</p>

<p>If the passphrases match, a keypair will be generated.</p>

<p>Your identification has been saved in /Users/PHPFog/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/PHPFog/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
31:be:4f:13:d4:68:f1:43:ea:97:9b:33:ad:b6:e5:85 us@phpfog.com
The key&rsquo;s randomart image is:
+&ndash;[ RSA 2048]&mdash;-+
| . . |
| B |
| o = + |
| . * o |
| S o o |
| . o + . |
| . o = E .|
| o ..* . |
| ..o.. |
+&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;+</p>

<p>Note: On windows the paths &ldquo;/Users/PHPFog/.ssh/&rdquo; is going to be different.</p>

<h3 id="copy-the-public-key-and-add-it-to-your-php-fog-account">6. Copy the public key and add it to your PHP Fog account.</h3>

<p>Open your public key with a text editor and copy the entire text. In this example the public key is stored at: /Users/PHPFog/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</p>

<p>A real key will look like:</p>

<p>ssh-rsa
AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDgMaD2kOEQAq0ir0C/U3880mFmpv

<h3 id="on-the-phpfog-site-go-to-the-ssh-keys">7.On the PHPFog site go to the SSH Keys.</h3>

<p>In the SSH Keys tab paste the public key into the &ldquo;Key&rdquo; field, give it a name, and hit &ldquo;Save Changes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it, you are done generating a new SSH Key and adding it to PHP Fog.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m reading through <a href="http://asupposedlyfunblog.wordpress.com/">A Supposedly Fun
Blog</a> and ran across <a href="http://asupposedlyfunblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/on-beauty/">this
passage</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€¦all of this, the aggrieved and distrustful critical reaction to any
novel that comes within a quarter mile of what we might call the
postmodern, has been established for years. It was well established, I
mean to say, when David Foster Wallace wrote Infinite Jest. Which
means that he, like all authors today, wrote in the knowledge that the
literary world would be filled with exactly those kinds of readers and
critics who would dismiss his work out of hand for its artiness and
pretension. And yet Foster Wallace wrote on, like a lot of writers do,
in the stubborn belief in the good faith of his audience.</p>

<p>(which is actually a blockquote from

<p>And it really speaks to what I love about DFW, because it&rsquo;s not like he
was without fear of being judged. It seems clear from his writing that
he was actually extraordinarily, excruciatingly self-conscious about it
all, but he did trek on.</p>

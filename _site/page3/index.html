	<h3>Google's Existential Crisis</h3><date datetime="Wed Jul 13 00:00:00 -0700 2011">July 13, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Google&rsquo;s success was founded on the execution1 of two innovations: 1. Leveraging the hyperlink to create the best index (i.e. crowd-sourcing); and 2. Targeting advertising to search results to monetize that index. Apparent diversification into new areas like content (YouTube) and operating systems (Android and Chrome OS) can be understood to exist in service to the two founding innovations. These driving principles are Google&rsquo;s DNA, and as successful as the company has been, if there are fundamental problems with these two principles, it could mean trouble for the company, and trouble for the web at large, to the extent that...</p>

	<h3>A New Metaphor for Social Networking</h3><date datetime="Wed Jun 29 00:00:00 -0700 2011">June 29, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Yesterday, Google launched Google+, which, according to Steven Levy&rsquo;s Wired article, is less of a product and more of a new direction for the search company, a redefinition of its approach to its core mission of &ldquo;organizing the world&rsquo;s information.&rdquo; Treating a social networking product as an extension of this mission is simultaneously reassuring and slightly creepy. Creepy because of the way Google constitutionally seems to treat people as just another category of information to be indexed, and, well, reassuring for the same reason, because it seems like a way for Google to finally get it right. There don&rsquo;t appear...</p>

	<h3>Project: Depth</h3><date datetime="Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 -0700 2011">June 14, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy traditional social settings like bars or parties. Partly this is because I can&rsquo;t hear very well, especially when there&rsquo;s a lot of background noise. But probably a more important reason is that I feel like a lot of the conversation that happens in these settings isn&rsquo;t productive. Not productive in the sense of making me money or advancing civilization, but in the sense of making us understand each other better on a more than superficial level, or in the sense of enlightening us or engaging us to some significant depth. From my perspective, most of the...</p>

	<h3>The Personal Cloud</h3><date datetime="Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 -0700 2011">June 06, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Things seem inexorably trending toward cloud models of computing.1 Which is great, right? You can have access to your data, apps, accounts, and settings from anywhere. Somebody else does all the administration, including security updates, backups, etc. And it all only gets better as the internet does, i.e. as connections get more ubiquitous and more ubiquitously faster. But if these things are cyclical, what does it look like when the pendulum swings back? Certainly there are reasons to want it to. There are the obvious privacy implications, which I don&rsquo;t actually care that much about. But there are also related...</p>

	<h3>Windows 8</h3><date datetime="Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 -0700 2011">June 04, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Microsoft unveiled a demo of their next version of Windows on Wednesday, and it appears that they&rsquo;re doubling down on Windows Phone 7&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; user interface. Which is great, because it (the UI) is the most novel, useful, and genuinely interesting thing Microsoft has done in the consumer space in a long time. And it&rsquo;s a surprisingly and encouragingly risky move, considering Windows Phone 7&rsquo;s limited success so far. There are some things I really like about the Metro UI. I love its departure from the WIMP paradigm, and in a direction other than the grid of icons. The idea...</p>

			<h2>Rat Holes</h2>
			<p><date datetime="2011-05-16 00:00:00 -0700">May 16, 2011</date><p>
		</div>
		<p>Rat holes I’ve fallen into:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Programming Languages.</li>
  <li>Programming books.</li>
  <li>Text editors.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.overclock.net/keyboards/491752-mechanical-keyboard-guide.html">Keyboards.</a></li>
  <li>Version control systems (Git).</li>
  <li>Password management.</li>
  <li>Backup.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rat holes I’ve got one foot in, but haven’t fallen all the way into, but
might still:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Web stuff. (Still sort of have one foot in this one.)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></li>
  <li>Linux/Unix.</li>
</ul>

<p>I eventually settled on Java, so I can work on Android. I eventually
settled on buying a specific Java book. I eventually settled on Vim. I
eventually settled on a keyboard (this is a minor one). I eventually
settled on a version control system (and I don’t even have a real use
for one yet).</p>

<p>Rat holes are things that I think I have to think about before
continuing my main project (learning to make software). They are
probably not things that are necessary to continue my project, but I
fall into them anyway. Some of them take a really long time to decide on
because they are often in some way religious or philosophical in nature
and the amount of research to be done is insanely deep and sometimes
leads in circles.</p>

<p>A positive, and partially true way of thinking about some of these rat
holes is that I want to use the best tools available to me, and I want
to learn to use these tools well before I start making something with
them. Chabo described it to me as depth-first traversal as opposed to
breadth-first traversal.</p>

<p>I think obsessive-compulsive completionism is one factor. The truth,
though, is probably that it’s easier and more fun to read about and
learn about this stuff than it is to get about the business of learning
to program. It’s peripherally useful procrastination, which is
potentially more harmful than plain goofing off because it can feel
productive because solving these more immediate concerns are more deeply
satisfying than making relatively small progress on the big project.</p>

<p>There is some value in rat holes. If you spend all day using a keyboard,
you should have a good one, just like if you spend all day sitting, you
should have a good chair; the value proposition simply dictates it. The
hard part is knowing how much value is in a given rat hole, and how much
work it will take to extract that value. But for someone new to a
domain, there isn’t a really good way to gauge the value proposition,
because the research necessary is part of the work of extraction and the
uncertainty of that position and the fear of path dependence can be
paralyzing.</p>

<p>Some people seem to be more or less immune to rat holes. Maybe the
distinction is simply between constitutionally pragmatic people and
constitutionally idealistic people. Or maybe it’s a distinction between
short-term thinking people and long-term thinking people. Either way,
the immune ones tend also not to worry much about what kind of keyboard
they have, or which text editor or IDE to use.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Rat hole avoidance heuristic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be aware of the phenomenon.</li>
  <li>Self-monitor. Periodically ask myself if I am entering or have
entered a rat hole.</li>
  <li>Determine whether I am in a blocking or non-blocking rat hole. (Can
I delay this decision until I know more about the domain?)</li>
  <li>If non-blocking, skip. Else do only enough research to make a quick
decision, and only invest enough time to not be blocked and move on.
Remind myself that I can change my mind later.</li>
  <li>Periodically ask myself whether and how this rat hole advances the
big project.</li>
</ol>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>I’d like to move my blog to a possibly self-hosted statically served
CMS like <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites">Jekyll</a>.
Why? Good question. <a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I think this is especially true where it pertains to aesthetics.
Generally, I think immune ones value function much higher than form,
and don’t worry about what their hardware or software looks like.<a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

			<h3>Google's Existential Crisis</h3><date datetime="2011-07-13 00:00:00 -0700">July 13, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">Google’s success was founded on the execution1 of two innovations: 1. Leveraging the hyperlink to create the best index (i.e. crowd-sourcing); and 2. Targeting advertising to search results to monetize that index. Apparent diversification into new areas like content (YouTube) and operating systems (Android and Chrome OS) can be understood to exist in service to the two founding innovations. These driving principles are Google’s DNA, and as successful as the company has been, if there are fundamental problems with these two principles, it could mean trouble for the company, and trouble for the web at large, to the extent that...</p>

			<h3>A New Metaphor for Social Networking</h3><date datetime="2011-06-29 00:00:00 -0700">June 29, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">Yesterday, Google launched Google+, which, according to Steven Levy’s Wired article, is less of a product and more of a new direction for the search company, a redefinition of its approach to its core mission of “organizing the world’s information.” Treating a social networking product as an extension of this mission is simultaneously reassuring and slightly creepy. Creepy because of the way Google constitutionally seems to treat people as just another category of information to be indexed, and, well, reassuring for the same reason, because it seems like a way for Google to finally get it right. There don’t appear...</p>

			<h3>Project: Depth</h3><date datetime="2011-06-14 00:00:00 -0700">June 14, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I don’t particularly enjoy traditional social settings like bars or parties. Partly this is because I can’t hear very well, especially when there’s a lot of background noise. But probably a more important reason is that I feel like a lot of the conversation that happens in these settings isn’t productive. Not productive in the sense of making me money or advancing civilization, but in the sense of making us understand each other better on a more than superficial level, or in the sense of enlightening us or engaging us to some significant depth. From my perspective, most of the...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Things seem inexorably trending toward cloud models of computing.1 Which is great, right? You can have access to your data, apps, accounts, and settings from anywhere. Somebody else does all the administration, including security updates, backups, etc. And it all only gets better as the internet does, i.e. as connections get more ubiquitous and more ubiquitously faster. But if these things are cyclical, what does it look like when the pendulum swings back? Certainly there are reasons to want it to. There are the obvious privacy implications, which I don’t actually care that much about. But there are also related...</p>

			<h3>Windows 8</h3><date datetime="2011-06-04 00:00:00 -0700">June 04, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">Microsoft unveiled a demo of their next version of Windows on Wednesday, and it appears that they’re doubling down on Windows Phone 7’s “Metro” user interface. Which is great, because it (the UI) is the most novel, useful, and genuinely interesting thing Microsoft has done in the consumer space in a long time. And it’s a surprisingly and encouragingly risky move, considering Windows Phone 7’s limited success so far. There are some things I really like about the Metro UI. I love its departure from the WIMP paradigm, and in a direction other than the grid of icons. The idea...</p>

			<h3>Rat Holes</h3><date datetime="2011-05-16 00:00:00 -0700">May 16, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">Rat holes I’ve fallen into: Programming Languages. Programming books. Text editors. Keyboards. Version control systems (Git). Password management. Backup. Rat holes I’ve got one foot in, but haven’t fallen all the way into, but might still: Web stuff. (Still sort of have one foot in this one.)1 Linux/Unix. I eventually settled on Java, so I can work on Android. I eventually settled on buying a specific Java book. I eventually settled on Vim. I eventually settled on a keyboard (this is a minor one). I eventually settled on a version control system (and I don’t even have a real use...</p>

			<p class="teaser">I’m typing this on a Cr-48, Google’s pilot hardware for Chrome OS. On Wednesday at the second keynote address of Google I/O, their developer conference, Google announced that final retail hardware will be available this Summer from Samsung and Acer. The day before, at the first keynote, they announced Android Ice Cream Sandwich (no version number yet), which will unify the OS across phones, tablets, and Google TV. While at first glance it may seem like Android and Chrome OS target the same space, the respective tones of the two keynotes and the pricing models of the coming Chromebooks indicate...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Television user interfaces could be so much better. I thought that with the introduction of set-top box internet video solutions, user interfaces would make menu and playback navigation and content management easier, especially now that we have ways to interact with these boxes using our smartphones.1 If anyone, I thought Apple–with their customary attention to user experience and their vertical integration–would have an elegant solution to interaction with TVs. But when I hooked up our new Apple TV22 and tested out the remote application on the iPod Touch and the iPad, all I got was a simulation of the physical...</p>

			<h3>Rationality Engine</h3><date datetime="2011-03-29 00:00:00 -0700">March 29, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">Paul Graham’s essay on disagreement, the discussion C-Rob started here, an interview with Jeff Atwood I heard recently, and a comment by Jake on GReader got me thinking about debate, though really more about how debate is sort of an implementation of rationality. Rationality, I think, is sort of self-evidently important, but not easy. Humans have natural cognitive biases that are hard to recognize, especially in oneself. Also, so much of our collective brainpower and discussion is spent/wasted on faulty arguments and corrections thereof. We could spend so much more of our cognition and time more effectively if we could...</p>

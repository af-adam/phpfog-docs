			<h3>More Convergence: How Twitter (as an open protocol, ideally) could (and maybe will) replace IM and all web commenting and make them both better</h3><date datetime="2009-05-21 00:00:00 -0700">May 21, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I’ve been messing with different Twitter clients. My favorite desktop client is still TwitterGadget, because it’s so lightweight and is fairly keyboard friendly (though it certainly has room to improve on this front). It’s actually a Gmail gadget, but I use it as a Prism application. Tweetdeck and Twhirl seem to be the most popular desktop clients, but they’re not that responsive for me maybe because they’re Adobe Air applications. I’m sure they’re great for heavy Twitter users, but for the functionality that Twitter provides for me at this point, all I really want is something simple and lightweight. SimplyTweet is still my favorite iPod Touch client, and I wish there was a desktop version, frankly. The feature list is really great, and includes: Instapaper support(!); a “View Conversation” button for each tweet, which is a bit buggy but is a really cool idea; grouping, in the form of “Saved Views” that filters by contact and “Saved Searches” which filters by keyword. Really, I think those are about all the features you need in a desktop client to replace IM and make Twitter more robust and give it a more immediate, IRC-like conversational feel. With #hashtags and direct messages, Twitter...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Most of my favorite Firefox add-ons have to do with maximizing browser window real estate. Stuff like Hide Menubar and Full Fullscreen. I’ve also replaced most of my bookmark menu items with Site Launcher, which gives quick keyboard access to bookmarks (including bookmarklets like Share in Google Reader). Prism is also a really cool add-on that creates sort of desktop web-apps. I use it with my twitter client of choice, Twitter Gadget, and with Gmail Tasks. Greasemonkey is potentially really powerful, but the only scripts I have running right now are Autopagerize, which ties a lot of pagerized web pages...</p>

			<h3>Torture</h3><date datetime="2009-04-26 00:00:00 -0700">April 26, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I’ve been following the torture stuff moderately closely. For people who haven’t been, the main arguments seem to boil down to: Is waterboarding (and other techniques authorized in the recently released legal memos) torture? Did it save lives? Should the people who conducted it be prosecuted? Should the people who authorized it be prosecuted? On the first question, I feel like Christopher Hitchens’ take on it, after subjecting himself to the experience, is pretty compelling. So is John McCain’s: Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure. It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and...</p>

			<h3>Twitter</h3><date datetime="2009-03-19 00:00:00 -0700">March 19, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I’ve been on twitter for a few months now, but I have to admit, I wasn’t really getting it until I read this. I mean, there are clearly many ways to use twitter, including the reason that twitter gives you: to broadcast your current status. But I, like many, don’t really feel the need to tell people when I’m pooping, and also don’t feel the need to know when others are pooping. I think this is why many people dismiss twitter, like I did until recently. But, in the exchange linked to above, something really familiar happens: someone overhears a...</p>

			<h3>Persistent Online Identity</h3><date datetime="2009-02-10 00:00:00 -0800">February 10, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">OpenID, OpenSocial, Disqus all seem to point to the inevitability of persistent online identities. I imagine this POLID as something that will follow you from site to site, and be easily aggregable into a lifestream or personal history of web interactions. This probably raises privacy concerns, but (Chabo and I have agreed) privacy is obsolete. Privacy is only going to become increasingly difficult to maintain, and it runs counter to transparency. I think transparency is good and the real way to deal with issues that privacy concerns seek to address is to combine more transparency with tolerance of deviant but...</p>

			<h3>Convergence, or All The Things I've Been Thinking About That Turned Out To Be The Same Thing</h3><date datetime="2008-12-30 00:00:00 -0800">December 30, 2008</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">So, I came pretty close to buying an iPhone because I found a deal for a refurbished 8GB 3G for $99. I ultimately decided not to after realizing that the cost of the device is really pretty trivial compared to the contractual commitment. I’m sure I’ll cave soon or later, but I’m going to try to wait until I have a real job and for there to be some more Android phones (I saw my first G1 in the wild a few days ago) on the market (which I think there will be a bunch more early in 2009, though I’ll probably be reluctant to buy a first generation Android phone from any manufacturer). But it got me thinking a lot about smart phones, and how they’re slowly turning into universal remotes, except not just for televisions and dvd players, but for everything. Kind of like what Ben Kingsley had in Sneakers. It also got me thinking about how a giant (like 10” screen) iPhone would be a great netbook/tablet, especially with Swype, which makes me think that netbooks are just big smart phones. A bunch of OEMs are supposed to release new touchscreen convertible (swivel-screen) netbooks at CES in...</p>

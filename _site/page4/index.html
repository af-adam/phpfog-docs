	<h3>Rat Holes</h3><date datetime="Mon May 16 00:00:00 -0700 2011">May 16, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Rat holes I&rsquo;ve fallen into: Programming Languages. Programming books. Text editors. Keyboards. Version control systems (Git). Password management. Backup. Rat holes I&rsquo;ve got one foot in, but haven&rsquo;t fallen all the way into, but might still: Web stuff. (Still sort of have one foot in this one.)1 Linux/Unix. I eventually settled on Java, so I can work on Android. I eventually settled on buying a specific Java book. I eventually settled on Vim. I eventually settled on a keyboard (this is a minor one). I eventually settled on a version control system (and I don&rsquo;t even have a real use...</p>

	<p class="teaser">I&rsquo;m typing this on a Cr-48, Google&rsquo;s pilot hardware for Chrome OS. On Wednesday at the second keynote address of Google I/O, their developer conference, Google announced that final retail hardware will be available this Summer from Samsung and Acer. The day before, at the first keynote, they announced Android Ice Cream Sandwich (no version number yet), which will unify the OS across phones, tablets, and Google TV. While at first glance it may seem like Android and Chrome OS target the same space, the respective tones of the two keynotes and the pricing models of the coming Chromebooks indicate...</p>

	<p class="teaser">Television user interfaces could be so much better. I thought that with the introduction of set-top box internet video solutions, user interfaces would make menu and playback navigation and content management easier, especially now that we have ways to interact with these boxes using our smartphones.1 If anyone, I thought Apple&ndash;with their customary attention to user experience and their vertical integration&ndash;would have an elegant solution to interaction with TVs. But when I hooked up our new Apple TV22 and tested out the remote application on the iPod Touch and the iPad, all I got was a simulation of the physical...</p>

	<p class="teaser">Paul Graham&rsquo;s essay on disagreement, the discussion C-Rob started here, an interview with Jeff Atwood I heard recently, and a comment by Jake on GReader got me thinking about debate, though really more about how debate is sort of an implementation of rationality. Rationality, I think, is sort of self-evidently important, but not easy. Humans have natural cognitive biases that are hard to recognize, especially in oneself. Also, so much of our collective brainpower and discussion is spent/wasted on faulty arguments and corrections thereof. We could spend so much more of our cognition and time more effectively if we could...</p>

	<h3>Climbing Rocks</h3><date datetime="Mon Mar 21 00:00:00 -0700 2011">March 21, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">I had been to a climbing gym once or twice, but only started climbing seriously while I was stationed in Okinawa in 2005. A friend of mine, Jay, took me outdoors and got me on a top-rope. I was hooked instantly. It was exhilirating, challenging, and focused my attention both mentally and physically in a way I&rsquo;d never really experienced before. Admittedly, the gear was no small part of the attraction at the beginning, and sport climbing involves a considerable amount of gear. &ldquo;Free-climbing,&rdquo; or class five climbing, is defined as climbing a vertical or near-vertical face under your own...</p>

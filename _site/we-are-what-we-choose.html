		<p>In <a href="http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/11/03/equipment-why-you-cant-convince-a-cyborg-shes-a-cyborg/">this post on
Cyborgology</a>,
PJ Rey convincingly speaks to the project of dismissing the concept of
digital dualism. He argues that as technology becomes sufficiently
advanced and ubiquitous, we begin to think of it as natural extensions
of ourselves.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As such, is [sic] not hyperbolic to claim, for example, that Facebook
is a piece of equipment that has become an extension of our very
consciousness. As equipment, social media fundamentally alters who we
are.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rings true for me. But more than anything else it emphasizes the
importance of thinking carefully about the ways in which we are
extending ourselves.</p>

<p>Noam Chomsky
<a href="http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/articles/the-secret-of-noam-a-chomsky-interview.htm">provoked</a>
a great discussion in the last few weeks by offhandedly dismissing new
media as &ldquo;extremely rapid, very shallow communication.&rdquo; Nathan Jurgenson
<a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/10/23/why_chomsky_is_wrong_about_twitter/singleton/">responded in a piece in
Salon</a>,
talking about the great benefits of new media, e.g. its utility in
popular movements like the Arab Spring and &ldquo;Occupy&rdquo; protests, as well as
the biases inherent in Chomsky&rsquo;s somewhat crotchety dismissal.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chomksy, of all people, ought to take note. When he defends his form
of communicating (printed books and periodical essays) with claims
that tweeting/texting lacks depth, he is implicitly suggesting that
nonwhites and those in the Third World are inherently communicating
less deeply than their white and first-world counterparts. He doesn&rsquo;t
seem to know enough about the reality of social media to examine his
own assumptions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But ultimately I agree most with <a href="http://figureground.ca/2011/10/31/why-chomsky-is-wrong-about-twitter-a-rebuttal/">this
post</a>
by Mike Plugh.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chomsky&rsquo;s critiques, while they seem to have some overtones of
morality, read in a particular way, aren&rsquo;t all that far off the mark.
The shallowness of social media forms, like Twitter, is both the
strength and the weakness of their nature. As a medium, Twitter is
largely superficial, shallow, and evanescent. One can only be so
‘deep&rsquo; in 140 characters or less, and so the superficiality of the
messages prompt higher involvement by the audience to derive meaning
(a largely positive characteristic), while at the same time leaving
out important depth behind the communication.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jurgenson rightly points out that, &ldquo;To some degree (and we can debate
how large this is) social media has enabled a mass manufacturing of
dissent.&rdquo; However, dissent is a contrary position, and a position
fueled by dissatisfaction and emotion. Immediate communication of a
type less-considered and nuanced is largely emotional in nature.
Again, this is a strength when outrage and action are the prescription
for intolerable circumstances, but do nothing little for producing
solutions or the important enlightened perspectives that must
accompany any change for it to be lasting and serve humanity most
broadly. Dissent as a state of moral indignation is useful and
important, but is also the same fuel that ignites the mob or the riot
when lacking in substance or focus. Manufacturing consent, as Chomsky
famously observed, is a process of propaganda which relies on
appealing superficially to people&rsquo;s gut emotions and less deeply
considered convictions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both posts are entirely worth reading.</p>

<p>I take from this discussion that not only do different digital tools
have different strengths and weaknesses for different activities, but
they each encourage certain types of behavior. To quote
<a href="http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/3112676038/the-end-of-comments">myself</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[The] quality of the connections on Facebook is very poor. And this is
because the signals are low bandwidth by design. Input fields for text
updates are small and restrictive. Photos are easy to share but poorly
presented, the system implemented not to share rich, expressive
photos, but low-grade, mundane, documentarian ones: I was here; I did
this; I was with these people. Ubiquitous interaction is reduced to
comment fields that encourage short, <em>ad hoc</em> reactions, or&ndash;worse&ndash;to
the elemental, further irreducible unary piece of information: the
&ldquo;like&rdquo; (though I suppose the &ldquo;poke&rdquo; contains even less information).
Facebook casts an extremely wide net into the waters of the collective
mind-space of its users, but that net penetrates only into the
shallowest of depths.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Twitter provides accessibility with a similar sacrifice of bandwidth.
I&rsquo;ve always felt like Twitter&rsquo;s great innovation was not the arbitrary
character limit, but the frictionless interface that collapses the
separation between input and output. The system itself doesn&rsquo;t judge
how noteworthy your expression is, leaving that to the network at
large in as close to a democratic way as is really conceivable. But
the limitations, also similarly to Facebook&rsquo;s, enforce a shallowness
of sentiment, encourage pith over comprehensiveness, and discourage
real discourse, or any sort of conversation at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/6542036868/project-depth">And the web itself sometimes seems inimical to depth of
thought</a>.</p>

<p>That we are subsuming technologies into ourselves seems trivial compared
to the point that what we are subsuming encourage us to think only in a
certain way. If we examine carefully what we are becoming, I don&rsquo;t think
we&rsquo;ll like what we find.</p>

<p>And some, like <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/">Nicholas
Carr</a>,
have already, and they don&rsquo;t like what they find at all. He, and,
presumably, Chomsky, would advocate, then, a retreat back to the old
media. Full-length books are what encourage the deep, sustained
concentration necessary for truly worthwhile thought. I think &ldquo;Digital
Fasting&rdquo; movements (restrictions of internet/screen time) also stem from
a sentiment that these technologies are having a pernicious effect on
us.</p>

<p>But a retreat to old media can&rsquo;t be the correct answer. Not only because
of the limits of physical media&ndash;like relegation to passive consumption
and the lack of communal experience&ndash;but also because the old media have
assumptions of their own built in that are just as pernicious. There is
an authoritarian centralization of power inherent to the old publishing
model, for example, as well as limited viable formats. Ideas of a
certain size, too long for long-form, but too short for full-length
books, simply had no way to exist in old media. They had to either be
cut down or inflated to fill viable formats.</p>

<p>New media have no such restrictions. In fact, our new digital tools are
the most versatile, plastic, and accessible that we&rsquo;ve ever had. We
should be honest and clear about what our tools are doing to us. But we
should then focus our energy on creating the tools that we want, instead
of trying to stop the inexorable tide of change.</p>

			<h3>Why I trust Google</h3><date datetime="Wed Aug 19 00:00:00 -0700 2009">August 19, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">From this article that Nick shared a while ago: Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements… A complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic complement of computer operating systems… Demand for a product increases when the prices of its complements decrease. For example, if flights to Miami become cheaper, demand for hotel rooms in Miami goes up&ndash;because more people are flying to Miami and need a room. When computers become cheaper, more people buy them, and they all need operating systems, so demand...</p>

			<h3>David Foster Wallace</h3><date datetime="Mon Jul 20 00:00:00 -0700 2009">July 20, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I&rsquo;m reading through A Supposedly Fun Blog and ran across this passage: …all of this, the aggrieved and distrustful critical reaction to any novel that comes within a quarter mile of what we might call the postmodern, has been established for years. It was well established, I mean to say, when David Foster Wallace wrote Infinite Jest. Which means that he, like all authors today, wrote in the knowledge that the literary world would be filled with exactly those kinds of readers and critics who would dismiss his work out of hand for its artiness and pretension. And yet Foster...</p>

			<h3>More Convergence: How Twitter (as an open protocol, ideally) could (and maybe will) replace IM and all web commenting and make them both better</h3><date datetime="Thu May 21 00:00:00 -0700 2009">May 21, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I&rsquo;ve been messing with different Twitter clients. My favorite desktop client is still TwitterGadget, because it&rsquo;s so lightweight and is fairly keyboard friendly (though it certainly has room to improve on this front). It&rsquo;s actually a Gmail gadget, but I use it as a Prism application. Tweetdeck and Twhirl seem to be the most popular desktop clients, but they&rsquo;re not that responsive for me maybe because they&rsquo;re Adobe Air applications. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re great for heavy Twitter users, but for the functionality that Twitter provides for me at this point, all I really want is something simple and lightweight. SimplyTweet...</p>

			<h3>A Few of My Favorite Things</h3><date datetime="Mon Apr 27 00:00:00 -0700 2009">April 27, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">Most of my favorite Firefox add-ons have to do with maximizing browser window real estate. Stuff like Hide Menubar and Full Fullscreen. I&rsquo;ve also replaced most of my bookmark menu items with Site Launcher, which gives quick keyboard access to bookmarks (including bookmarklets like Share in Google Reader). Prism is also a really cool add-on that creates sort of desktop web-apps. I use it with my twitter client of choice, Twitter Gadget, and with Gmail Tasks. Greasemonkey is potentially really powerful, but the only scripts I have running right now are Autopagerize, which ties a lot of pagerized web pages...</p>

			<h3>Torture</h3><date datetime="Sun Apr 26 00:00:00 -0700 2009">April 26, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I&rsquo;ve been following the torture stuff moderately closely. For people who haven&rsquo;t been, the main arguments seem to boil down to: Is waterboarding (and other techniques authorized in the recently released legal memos) torture? Did it save lives? Should the people who conducted it be prosecuted? Should the people who authorized it be prosecuted? On the first question, I feel like Christopher Hitchens&rsquo; take on it, after subjecting himself to the experience, is pretty compelling. So is John McCain&rsquo;s: Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure. It is a horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and...</p>

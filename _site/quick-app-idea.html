<p>Here&rsquo;s an idea for a distributed, peer-to-peer (though not massively
distributed, probably no more than three nodes in any network) backup
system that&rsquo;s sort of a mix between Dropbox and a backup service like
Carbonite or Backblaze.</p>

<p>Off-site backup is probably a really good idea. But. I&rsquo;m not sure if
it&rsquo;s a good enough idea that I want to pay a monthly fee for it. And I
would imagine that most people have a significant amount of excess
storage in their homes. So this app would incorporate that excess
storage with the background syncing of one of the services mentioned
above.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how it would look in practice: you and a friend install the
software and set aside a certain amount of space for the other user. You
set certain folders to backup, and the software waits until it&rsquo;s late at
night or cpu/bandwidth is not being used, and syncs the folders to an
encrypted thing on the other node.</p>

<p>It would be fairly fire-and-forget, though it would have to notify you
if you&rsquo;re getting close to the storage limit you&rsquo;ve been allocated by
your friend (stingy jerk).</p>

<p>You could also just set this up between your home and work computers,
say. I can imagine, too, for even more simplicity, a completely
closed-box system, a piece of hardware that&rsquo;s basically a big hdd with
an ethernet port and this app on it that you could stick on a friend&rsquo;s
home network or your work network.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d pay (once) for this.</p>

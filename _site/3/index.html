			<h3>Climbing Rocks</h3><date datetime="2011-03-21 00:00:00 -0700">March 21, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I had been to a climbing gym once or twice, but only started climbing seriously while I was stationed in Okinawa in 2005. A friend of mine, Jay, took me outdoors and got me on a top-rope. I was hooked instantly. It was exhilirating, challenging, and focused my attention both mentally and physically in a way I’d never really experienced before. Admittedly, the gear was no small part of the attraction at the beginning, and sport climbing involves a considerable amount of gear. “Free-climbing,” or class five climbing, is defined as climbing a vertical or near-vertical face under your own...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Apple beat even the most optimistic expectations and sold over 15 million iPads in the first year of its release, and it looks like the second version is just around the corner. The competitors are lining up as well: the Motorola Xoom, running Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the HP PalmPad, and the RIM Playbook all look like interesting offerings.1 Many have pointed out the sad irony of the fact that Microsoft, who has been pushing tablet PCs for over a decade, seems to have by far the least compelling offering, and no apparent serious road map for future products that address...</p>

			<p class="teaser">I think it’s pertinent to note first that my thoughts on this thread and some others comes from a place of deep interest in technology, but basic technical laity. I have very little understanding of what’s under the floorboards of the internet. I mostly only see the levers and buttons that are exposed to me, and can imagine many lever/button layouts that would potentially make my life easier and better without first being hobbled by the foreknowledge of the many (I’m sure) technical limitations. I will try to discuss the technical aspects as far as I am able, but be...</p>

			<p class="teaser">It’s a truism that medium and message are intrinsically intertwined. This is the problem I have with the emerging (or maybe more accurately: emerged) social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I don’t care about the privacy implications (besides Facebook’s dis-ingenuousness toward the issues and the inherent conflicts of interest) so much as I care about the inherent restrictiveness of expression. In this review of The Social Network, Zadie Smith talks about how Mark Zuckerberg’s personal limitations inform and define Facebook’s. The striking thing about the real Zuckerberg, in video and in print, is the relative banality of his ideas...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Sounds like a few people got Kindles for Christmas, so I thought I’d share my last couple months’ experiences: The hardware is almost flawless, and a big step up from the previous incarnations of the Kindle. The cleaner, more cohesive design is understated and minimalist. The matte charcoal finish provides better contrast to the negative space on the reading surface, making it appear closer to white. The slightly rubbery soft-touch plastic finish feels fanastic in the hand, with just the right amount of grip, and the newly consistent bezel width around the screen rounds out the device’s proportions nicely. It’s...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Here’s an idea for a distributed, peer-to-peer (though not massively distributed, probably no more than three nodes in any network) backup system that’s sort of a mix between Dropbox and a backup service like Carbonite or Backblaze. Off-site backup is probably a really good idea. But. I’m not sure if it’s a good enough idea that I want to pay a monthly fee for it. And I would imagine that most people have a significant amount of excess storage in their homes. So this app would incorporate that excess storage with the background syncing of one of the services mentioned...</p>

			<p class="teaser">There was a lot of mayhem surrounding the release of Google Buzz that I’ve been thinking about. First, of course, were the many complaints about privacy, some of which were entirely reasonable, and others of which were not. I think most of the reasonable complaints boil down to the actual, technical process of releasing the technology as opposed to the technology itself, which when regarded alone doesn’t add anything particularly novel to the social networking ecosystem. These actual, technical process issues, like integrating with GMail and automatically populating a public contact list, etc. are not especially interesting to me, and...</p>

			<p class="teaser">From this article that Nick shared a while ago: Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements… A complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic complement of computer operating systems… Demand for a product increases when the prices of its complements decrease. For example, if flights to Miami become cheaper, demand for hotel rooms in Miami goes up–because more people are flying to Miami and need a room. When computers become cheaper, more people buy them, and they all need operating systems, so demand...</p>

			<h3>David Foster Wallace</h3><date datetime="2009-07-20 00:00:00 -0700">July 20, 2009</date><p class="description"></p>
			<p class="teaser">I’m reading through A Supposedly Fun Blog and ran across this passage: …all of this, the aggrieved and distrustful critical reaction to any novel that comes within a quarter mile of what we might call the postmodern, has been established for years. It was well established, I mean to say, when David Foster Wallace wrote Infinite Jest. Which means that he, like all authors today, wrote in the knowledge that the literary world would be filled with exactly those kinds of readers and critics who would dismiss his work out of hand for its artiness and pretension. And yet Foster...</p>

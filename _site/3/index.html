			<p class="teaser">I had been to a climbing gym once or twice, but only started climbing seriously while I was stationed in Okinawa in 2005. A friend of mine, Jay, took me outdoors and got me on a top-rope. I was hooked instantly. It was exhilirating, challenging, and focused my attention both...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

			<p class="teaser">Apple beat even the most optimistic expectations and sold over 15 million iPads in the first year of its release, and it looks like the second version is just around the corner. The competitors are lining up as well: the Motorola Xoom, running Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the HP PalmPad, and...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

			<p class="teaser">I think it&rsquo;s pertinent to note first that my thoughts on this thread and some others comes from a place of deep interest in technology, but basic technical laity. I have very little understanding of what&rsquo;s under the floorboards of the internet. I mostly only see the levers and buttons...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

			<p class="teaser">It&rsquo;s a truism that medium and message are intrinsically intertwined. This is the problem I have with the emerging (or maybe more accurately: emerged) social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I don&rsquo;t care about the privacy implications (besides Facebook&rsquo;s dis-ingenuousness toward the issues and the inherent conflicts of interest)...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

The cleaner, more cohesive design is understated and minimalist. The matte charcoal finish provides...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

			<p class="teaser">Here&rsquo;s an idea for a distributed, peer-to-peer (though not massively distributed, probably no more than three nodes in any network) backup system that&rsquo;s sort of a mix between Dropbox and a backup service like Carbonite or Backblaze. Off-site backup is probably a really good idea. But. I&rsquo;m not sure if...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

			<p class="teaser">There was a lot of mayhem surrounding the release of Google Buzz that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about. First, of course, were the many complaints about privacy, some of which were entirely reasonable, and others of which were not. I think most of the reasonable complaints boil down to the actual,...<br />[Read More &rarr;]</p>

			<p class="teaser">I had been to a climbing gym once or twice, but only started climbing seriously while I was stationed in Okinawa in 2005. A friend of mine, Jay, took me outdoors and got me on a top-rope. I was hooked instantly. It was exhilirating, challenging, and focused my attention both...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Apple beat even the most optimistic expectations and sold over 15 million iPads in the first year of its release, and it looks like the second version is just around the corner. The competitors are lining up as well: the Motorola Xoom, running Android 3.0 Honeycomb, the HP PalmPad, and...</p>

			<p class="teaser">I think it’s pertinent to note first that my thoughts on this thread and some others comes from a place of deep interest in technology, but basic technical laity. I have very little understanding of what’s under the floorboards of the internet. I mostly only see the levers and buttons...</p>

			<p class="teaser">It’s a truism that medium and message are intrinsically intertwined. This is the problem I have with the emerging (or maybe more accurately: emerged) social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I don’t care about the privacy implications (besides Facebook’s dis-ingenuousness toward the issues and the inherent conflicts of interest)...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Sounds like a few people got Kindles for Christmas, so I thought I’d share my last couple months’ experiences: The hardware is almost flawless, and a big step up from the previous incarnations of the Kindle. The cleaner, more cohesive design is understated and minimalist. The matte charcoal finish provides...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Here’s an idea for a distributed, peer-to-peer (though not massively distributed, probably no more than three nodes in any network) backup system that’s sort of a mix between Dropbox and a backup service like Carbonite or Backblaze. Off-site backup is probably a really good idea. But. I’m not sure if...</p>

			<p class="teaser">There was a lot of mayhem surrounding the release of Google Buzz that I’ve been thinking about. First, of course, were the many complaints about privacy, some of which were entirely reasonable, and others of which were not. I think most of the reasonable complaints boil down to the actual,...</p>

			<p class="teaser">From this article that Nick shared a while ago: Every product in the marketplace has substitutes and complements… A complement is a product that you usually buy together with another product. Gas and cars are complements. Computer hardware is a classic complement of computer operating systems… Demand for a product...</p>

			<p class="teaser">I’m reading through A Supposedly Fun Blog and ran across this passage: …all of this, the aggrieved and distrustful critical reaction to any novel that comes within a quarter mile of what we might call the postmodern, has been established for years. It was well established, I mean to say,...</p>

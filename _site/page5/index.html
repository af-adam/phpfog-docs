			<p class="teaser">I think it&rsquo;s pertinent to note first that my thoughts on this thread and some others comes from a place of deep interest in technology, but basic technical laity. I have very little understanding of what&rsquo;s under the floorboards of the internet. I mostly only see the levers and buttons that are exposed to me, and can imagine many lever/button layouts that would potentially make my life easier and better without first being hobbled by the foreknowledge of the many (I&rsquo;m sure) technical limitations. I will try to discuss the technical aspects as far as I am able, but be...</p>

			<p class="teaser">It&rsquo;s a truism that medium and message are intrinsically intertwined. This is the problem I have with the emerging (or maybe more accurately: emerged) social networking platforms like Facebook and Twitter. I don&rsquo;t care about the privacy implications (besides Facebook&rsquo;s dis-ingenuousness toward the issues and the inherent conflicts of interest) so much as I care about the inherent restrictiveness of expression. In this review of The Social Network, Zadie Smith talks about how Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s personal limitations inform and define Facebook&rsquo;s. The striking thing about the real Zuckerberg, in video and in print, is the relative banality of his ideas...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Sounds like a few people got Kindles for Christmas, so I thought I&rsquo;d share my last couple months&rsquo; experiences: The hardware is almost flawless, and a big step up from the previous incarnations of the Kindle. The cleaner, more cohesive design is understated and minimalist. The matte charcoal finish provides better contrast to the negative space on the reading surface, making it appear closer to white. The slightly rubbery soft-touch plastic finish feels fanastic in the hand, with just the right amount of grip, and the newly consistent bezel width around the screen rounds out the device&rsquo;s proportions nicely. It&rsquo;s...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Here&rsquo;s an idea for a distributed, peer-to-peer (though not massively distributed, probably no more than three nodes in any network) backup system that&rsquo;s sort of a mix between Dropbox and a backup service like Carbonite or Backblaze. Off-site backup is probably a really good idea. But. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a good enough idea that I want to pay a monthly fee for it. And I would imagine that most people have a significant amount of excess storage in their homes. So this app would incorporate that excess storage with the background syncing of one of the services mentioned...</p>

			<p class="teaser">There was a lot of mayhem surrounding the release of Google Buzz that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about. First, of course, were the many complaints about privacy, some of which were entirely reasonable, and others of which were not. I think most of the reasonable complaints boil down to the actual, technical process of releasing the technology as opposed to the technology itself, which when regarded alone doesn&rsquo;t add anything particularly novel to the social networking ecosystem. These actual, technical process issues, like integrating with GMail and automatically populating a public contact list, etc. are not especially interesting to me, and...</p>

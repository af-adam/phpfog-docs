	<h3>Intimacy and Performance on Facebook</h3><date datetime="Tue Sep 27 00:00:00 -0700 2011">September 27, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Facebook launched three interesting new features last Thursday: Timeline, Ticker, and Open Graph. Timeline Timeline is a replacement for the profile page that collects and displays your Facebook status updates, photos, links, etc. in a clean, easily perusable way. One of the first things I thought of after seeing the announcement, was this &ldquo;Dear Sophie&rdquo; ad from Google. Superficially, they&rsquo;re very similar. Both showcase the use of technology to capture meaningful events and share them. Even the types of relationships and events are similar. But the different presentations betray an important distinction in purpose between the two sets of services....</p>

	<p class="teaser">In a talk last Friday at the dConstruct conference, design luminary Don Norman repeated an increasingly popular refrain about Google: &ldquo;[In] fact, the advertisers are the users and you are the product.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the kind of glib soundbite that certain bloggers can&rsquo;t resist, but collapses on close scrutiny. The argument goes something like this: You are only truly a company&rsquo;s customer if you pay them directly for products or services. Google users don&rsquo;t pay Google directly, therefore Google users are not Google customers, but products that Google sells to advertisers. The logic that underlies this argument is that a user...</p>

	<p class="teaser">Paul Buchheit coined Google&rsquo;s unofficial motto&ndash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo;&ndash;early in the company&rsquo;s existence. But Google has only been pushing the vague notion of &ldquo;open&rdquo; in the last few years. The notion is vague at least partly because it&rsquo;s so all-encompassing and partly because of Google&rsquo;s penchant for using it in whatever way is most convenient at the time. But that sword cuts both ways, as it makes it easy for Google&rsquo;s critics to call the company out when they don&rsquo;t live up to an equally vague standard. So, what exactly does Google mean by â€˜open,&rsquo; and how open is Google? Open...</p>

	<p class="teaser">&ldquo;In the beginning was the command line.&rdquo; But then the command line became graphics and dwelt among us. From its earliest days, Apple privileged the lay user over the technical one, regarding the need to understand technical details as friction. With the Lisa and the Macintosh, Apple picked up where Xerox Palo Alto Research Center left off. The guiding principles of intuitiveness and discoverability led Apple to replace the command line interface (CLI) with the graphical user interface (GUI), featuring windows, menus, icons, and a pointing device (WIMP). For these historical reasons, the GUI has always been pointer-driven, at least...</p>

	<h3>Google, Motorola, and Patents</h3><date datetime="Tue Aug 16 00:00:00 -0700 2011">August 16, 2011</date><p class="description"></p>
	<p class="teaser">Google is buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. It&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s largest acquisition ever. And it&rsquo;s clearly about patents. But before I go into the issue of patents more broadly, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what Google is buying exactly. Motorola Mobility (MMI), which was the handset and cable box division of Motorola, spun off early this year. Motorola obviously has a long history in the mobile industry (they own the now expired patent on the cell phone) and have a deep and presumably strong patent portfolio. This includes about 14,300 patents, and 6,700 patents pending. According to this, in...</p>

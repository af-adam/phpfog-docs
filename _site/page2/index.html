			<p class="teaser">In a talk last Friday at the dConstruct conference, design luminary Don Norman repeated an increasingly popular refrain about Google: &ldquo;[In] fact, the advertisers are the users and you are the product.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s the kind of glib soundbite that certain bloggers can&rsquo;t resist, but collapses on close scrutiny. The argument goes something like this: You are only truly a company&rsquo;s customer if you pay them directly for products or services. Google users don&rsquo;t pay Google directly, therefore Google users are not Google customers, but products that Google sells to advertisers. The logic that underlies this argument is that a user...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Paul Buchheit coined Google&rsquo;s unofficial motto&ndash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be evil&rdquo;&ndash;early in the company&rsquo;s existence. But Google has only been pushing the vague notion of &ldquo;open&rdquo; in the last few years. The notion is vague at least partly because it&rsquo;s so all-encompassing and partly because of Google&rsquo;s penchant for using it in whatever way is most convenient at the time. But that sword cuts both ways, as it makes it easy for Google&rsquo;s critics to call the company out when they don&rsquo;t live up to an equally vague standard. So, what exactly does Google mean by â€˜open,&rsquo; and how open is Google? Open...</p>

			<p class="teaser">&ldquo;In the beginning was the command line.&rdquo; But then the command line became graphics and dwelt among us. From its earliest days, Apple privileged the lay user over the technical one, regarding the need to understand technical details as friction. With the Lisa and the Macintosh, Apple picked up where Xerox Palo Alto Research Center left off. The guiding principles of intuitiveness and discoverability led Apple to replace the command line interface (CLI) with the graphical user interface (GUI), featuring windows, menus, icons, and a pointing device (WIMP). For these historical reasons, the GUI has always been pointer-driven, at least...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Google is buying Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion. It&rsquo;s Google&rsquo;s largest acquisition ever. And it&rsquo;s clearly about patents. But before I go into the issue of patents more broadly, let&rsquo;s take a quick look at what Google is buying exactly. Motorola Mobility (MMI), which was the handset and cable box division of Motorola, spun off early this year. Motorola obviously has a long history in the mobile industry (they own the now expired patent on the cell phone) and have a deep and presumably strong patent portfolio. This includes about 14,300 patents, and 6,700 patents pending. According to this, in...</p>

			<p class="teaser">Google&rsquo;s success was founded on the execution1 of two innovations: 1. Leveraging the hyperlink to create the best index (i.e. crowd-sourcing); and 2. Targeting advertising to search results to monetize that index. Apparent diversification into new areas like content (YouTube) and operating systems (Android and Chrome OS) can be understood to exist in service to the two founding innovations. These driving principles are Google&rsquo;s DNA, and as successful as the company has been, if there are fundamental problems with these two principles, it could mean trouble for the company, and trouble for the web at large, to the extent that...</p>

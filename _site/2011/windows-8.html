			<h2>Windows 8</h2>
			<p><date datetime="Sat Jun 04 00:00:00 -0700 2011">June 04, 2011</date><p>
		</div>
		<p>Microsoft unveiled <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p92QfWOw88I&amp;feature=player_embedded">a
demo</a>
of their next version of Windows on Wednesday, and it appears that
they&rsquo;re doubling down on Windows Phone 7&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; user interface. Which
is great, because it (the UI) is the most novel, useful, and genuinely
interesting thing Microsoft has done in the consumer space in a long
time. And it&rsquo;s a surprisingly and encouragingly risky move, considering
Windows Phone 7&rsquo;s limited success so far.</p>

<p>There are some things I really like about the Metro UI. I love its
departure from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a>
paradigm, and in a direction other than the grid of icons. The idea of
rich, interactive tiles is great,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> as is the idea of making
shortcuts to discrete functions of apps as opposed to the apps
themselves and the concept of &ldquo;hubs&rdquo; that collect data from across
applicable apps.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas in the demo that extend Metro for Windows 8 are
fantastic, too. The implementation of multi-tasking (actually having two
apps on the screen at once, not running background apps) is basically
what I&rsquo;ve been wanting for a while.</p>

<p>Maybe the most interesting part, though, was the exposure of legacy
Windows 7 programs running alongside the new Windows 8 interface. While
it&rsquo;s superficially jarring to see two such different UI styles
juxtaposed, the really interesting idea that it presents is a
convertible device that exposes an intuitive, simplified, pared-down
interface in one orientation, and another more robust, complex, and
capable interface in the other.</p>

<p>The obvious application for this is a tablet that you can use as an
iPad-like consumption device for casual use that you can dock to a mouse
and keyboard for &ldquo;real work&rdquo; and maintain all the functionality of a PC.
There are some instances of something like this already: tablet/laptop
convertibles that dual boot into Android and Windows 7; as well as the
Motorola Atrix, an Android phone that you can dock into a laptop-like
terminal device and boots into a linux-based web browser environment.
Windows 8, though, forks the abstraction at a different level, which
makes it much more compelling by making it almost a matter of separating
function and data from presentation. Ideally, the two modes would offer
potentially the exact same data and (selective) functionality in two
separate but consistent experiences, instead of the weird split-brain
experiences of current offerings.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In much the same way that the Metro UI&rsquo;s introduction answered the
question of mobile interface in a refreshingly novel way, this dualistic
(Platonic?) paradigm skirts the conceit of the iPad, and addresses the
inherent compromises in a qualitatively different manner. While the iPad
manages expectations by offering a completely separate and different
experience that&rsquo;s tailored to the device, Windows 8 offers full
functionality but in a crucially context-sensitive fashion.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a really fascinating idea, but Microsoft has a very difficult
execution ahead of them. Unless they&rsquo;re prepared to seriously rethink
the dominant mode of robust input,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> they&rsquo;re going to have to
figure out a way to seamlessly integrate and reconcile a fundamentally
touch-based direct-interaction interface with a fundamentally more
abstract, indirectly manipulated one. Additionally, they&rsquo;ll have to
address whether developers are going to have to create two separate
interfaces to all of their apps.</p>

<p>This exposes a more important and fundamental challenge, though. The
problem that Microsoft appears to be trying to solve with Windows 8 is
that of being able to take all of your computing with you wherever you
go, and have the full experience available to you, and its solution is
predicated on a particular confluence of technologies becoming mature
and robust enough for this to be feasible. The implementation of iOS was
similarly predicated on battery life and low power consumption
processors finally becoming powerful enough to run a serious operating
system on. But as Moore&rsquo;s Law&rsquo;s continuing influence makes
hardware/power/bandwidth even cheaper, another solution to this problem
that&rsquo;s being worked in parallel is becoming even more feasible,
interesting, capable, and solves another set of problems at the same
time: the cloud.</p>

<p>Which renders a lot of this dicussion moot. As web technologies become
more powerful and users realize more and more that they don&rsquo;t need
everything that traditional desktop applications have to offer, more of
the things that sit between the user and the browser becomes
overhead.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> After the web hits a certain level of robustness,
these differences between operating system user interfaces are ones
simply of chrome preference. They become commodities.</p>

<p>To reiterate: I like a lot of what Microsoft is trying to do with
Windows 8, and I applaud their direction of energy and ambition. But it
seems like a solidly middle-term goal that doesn&rsquo;t relate to a long-term
goal in any real way. Maybe it&rsquo;s a great way to maximize productivity
and extract value from a technological valley, but it in no way
addresses the mountain on the other side, which is steep and high enough
to poke through the clouds.</p>

    <li id="fn:1">
      <p>They are, however, not exactly original. Android&rsquo;s widgets offer the
same utility, and more. Metro&rsquo;s solution is considerably more
elegant and unifying, which brings up something of a UI paradox: It
looks so much cleaner and prettier when everything is consistent and
uniform, but it does make it that much harder to
differentiate/distinguish the different tiles/icons, especially
quickly. <a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:2">
      <p>I imagine even the desktop mode and desktop applications will get a
UI revamp to make them more Metro-y, aesthetically at the very
least. <a href="#fnref:2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:3">
      <p>As John Gruber
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/ice_water_enthusiast">notes</a>, the
touch-based, direct-manipulation UI model is only one part of how
iOS simplifies the user experience. Other ways include: hiding the
file system, single-tasking full-screen apps, and platform-specific
apps built from the ground up with the specific interface in mind.
(Gruber also notes other differences like battery life that I don&rsquo;t
think relate to the discussion at hand.)<a href="#fnref:3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>Even if they do, how will legacy apps integrate into the new system?
It&rsquo;s an important question because legacy support is one of the
reasons Microsoft can&rsquo;t just do a complete reboot or a completely
separate operating system for tablets or simply extend Windows Phone
7 for tablets. <a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:5">
      <p>That&rsquo;s obviously a sort of Google-centric way of seeing things, but
even Microsoft acknowledges the trend with its own web-based
offerings of Office, and with its announcement that Windows 8
development will be done in HTML and Javascript.<a href="#fnref:5" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

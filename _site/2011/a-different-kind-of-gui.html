		<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://artlung.com/smorgasborg/C_R_Y_P_T_O_N_O_M_I_C_O_N.shtml">In the beginning was the command line</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But then the command line became graphics and dwelt among us. From its earliest days, Apple privileged the lay user over the technical one, regarding the need to understand technical details as friction. With the Lisa and the Macintosh, Apple picked up where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Parc">Xerox Palo Alto Research Center</a> left off. The guiding principles of intuitiveness and discoverability led Apple to replace the command line interface (CLI) with the graphical user interface (GUI), featuring windows, menus, icons, and a pointing device (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIMP_(computing)">WIMP</a>).</p>

<p>For these historical reasons, the GUI has always been pointer-driven, at least with respect to computer operating systems. Apple has only recently begun the transition to something new: iOS&rsquo;s direct manipulation interface; still a GUI, but no longer driven by the same windows or menus or a pointing device. With this transition, Apple achieved its oldest dream more successfully than anyone anticipated. And it now seems to be pulling the rest of its product line into that dream. To use Steve Jobs&rsquo; terminology, they&rsquo;re slowly transitioning out of <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/06/cars-trucks-and-ipads">the &ldquo;truck&rdquo; business</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-mouse">The Mouse</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s enlightening to consider what made the mouse such an indispensable companion to the GUI for so long.</p>

<ol>
  <li>It&rsquo;s intuitive. It&rsquo;s easy to grasp the basic concept that the cursor
 is an extension of the hand, that its motion corresponds to the
 motion of the mouse.</li>
  <li>All interactions are built on a minimal set of axiomatic actions:
 move, hover, click, release, and drag.</li>
  <li>It provides highly precise and unrestricted motion of the cursor, as
 opposed to a joystick, which limits the cursor&rsquo;s direction and
 velocity.</li>
</ol>

<p>With careful application of the WIMP metaphor, these features made every
aspect of a GUI accessible to the user. But this was only the minimal
set afforded by the technology that was available at the time. With
touch screen technology and the direct manipulation paradigm, Apple has
not just removed an entire layer of abstraction, but also reduced that
minimal set of actions even further to a more intuitive level: tap,
swipe, and pinch. The resulting interface is qualitatively more
intuitive and trivially easy for new users.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>But restricting the minimal set of actions that far has implications
that I think Apple is only starting to realize. With such a limited
interaction bandwidth, for example, any given complex action has to take
a correspondingly large number of sequential inputs. Apple&rsquo;s way of
mitigating this effect in iOS appears to be gestures, some of which,
like five-finger pinch, are frankly ridiculous. Traditional desktop GUIs
mitigate this by overloading the basic controls with incrementally added
extra functionality that breaks metaphor: double-click, right-click, the
scroll wheel, any number of additional mouse buttons. These are all
extremely useful additions (because they increase the interaction
bandwidth), but this phenomenon is actually part of what makes modern
desktop GUIs inaccessible to novices and is why I imagine Apple has
traditionally been so resistant to these kinds of innovations. But I
think the underlying problem isn&rsquo;t simply the tendency for cruft to
accumulate, but the severely limiting nature of the metaphor to begin
with. iOS, just a few years old, already contains more undiscoverable,
out-of-metaphor inputs (gestures) than discoverable strictly in-metaphor
ones.</p>

<p>But even aside from the unintuitiveness, there are a lot of reasons not
to like the mouse:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The arbitrary motion of a mouse cursor makes the effort analog, as
 opposed to the digital motion of keying. Commands, even repetitive
 ones, can&rsquo;t be relegated to muscle memory the way command line
 commands or keyboard navigation can.</li>
  <li>Because of this, mousing is a conscious process. Hitting precise
 targets takes a lot more cognitive effort and close attention than
 keying.</li>
  <li>Moving the mouse hand back and forth between mouse and keyboard is
 often an annoying cognitive task-switch and that breaks flow.</li>
  <li>The requirement of moving back and forth between mouse and keyboard
 creates friction for typing. And since typing is one of the main
 ways of producing content, this friction is a particular type that
 only applies to production and not to consumption.</li>
  <li>It&rsquo;s slower, or feels slower. (According to <a href="http://www.asktog.com/TOI/toi06KeyboardVMouse1.html">Bruce
 Tognazzini</a>,
 Apple R&amp;D found that mousing is in fact faster than keyboarding.
 This strikes me as highly dubious today not only for all the reasons
 given above, but also because the article is from 1989 and the
 research is presumably from before that. I believe the research was
 also done on non-expert users.</li>
  <li>While the high degree of precision afforded by the mouse is a boon
 to applications that benefit from it, as the dominant mode of
 interaction, it forces that level of precision on every transaction.
 For every dialogue box with two simple choices, for example, the
 user still must traverse an arbitrary distance and hit a cursor
 target that is tiny relative to the rest of the screen, which is,
 for the transaction, completely unused. So to make an input that&rsquo;s
 essentially a binary 0 or 1, the user in real terms has to make a
 huge, well-calibrated, cognitively expensive analog input that&rsquo;s
 largely wasted.</li>
</ol>

<p>With OS X 10.7 Lion, Apple presents a clear and well-documented
iOSification of OS X.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> A prominent sign to me is the seeming
move toward deprecating the mouse, replacing and adding functionality
with touchpad gestures. I empathize with the desire to leave the mouse
behind. But where some of the iOS gestures are quite silly, the
decisions Apple has made about Lion&rsquo;s touchpad gestures are strange in a
different way. I&rsquo;ve discussed
<a href="http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/3556631202/touch-ui-is-not-the-future-of-everything">before</a>
Apple&rsquo;s attempt to render the direct manipulation interface of iOS on
the fundamentally indirect interface of the desktop. But aside from
that, these gestures are no more efficient or discoverable than keyboard
shortcuts and they do make you move your hand off the keyboard. While
they are arguably a bit more intuitive and reminiscent<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> of a
real touch-based direct manipulation input system, it&rsquo;s at heart really
just a case of trading one set of undiscoverable metaphors for another.
At least with keyboard shortcuts, it&rsquo;s possible to expose functionality
because the keys have a conventional labeling system built in. Gestures
do not. I don&rsquo;t see any real way to reconcile the inherent and
fundamental difference between the two paradigms (direct and indirect)
with the <a href="http://procrastineering.blogspot.com/2011/07/myth-of-dying-mouse.html">ergonomic
constraints</a>
of different types of computing. Maybe Apple&rsquo;s solution will be to
further marginalize the needs of the technical user and simply move to a
touch-only interface, with touch-screen laptops as their physically
largest products. It&rsquo;ll be interesting to see.</p>

<h3 id="building-blocks">Building Blocks</h3>

<p>But if this does mark the beginning of the end of the pointing
device-driven model for consumer computing, it seems like a good time to
rethink the technical user&rsquo;s computing experience, unburdened by the
need to cater to the novice or non-technical user. While the CLI seems
to be regaining prominence and popularity among some subset of users, I
don&rsquo;t think a return to the command line is practical. The GUI has
introduced some concepts and workflows that are very powerful. As real
computers with dedicated input devices become more and more relegated to
technical users, maybe a more robust but less intuitive interface
becomes more viable. In fact, maybe we can abandon ‘intuitiveness&rsquo; as
the primary motivator or at least stop defining the word as minimal
interaction bandwidth.</p>

<p>Some starting points:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A purposefully high-bandwidth interaction model, i.e. a large but
 consistent set of initial undiscoverable actions to learn, that, at
 best, isn&rsquo;t meaningfully less ‘intuitive,&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> but instead
 simply has a learning curve with a different shape.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></li>
  <li>The mouse is too powerful to get rid of entirely. There are many
 applications for which it is an ideal or at least very appropriate
 input device, such as graphics rendering, photo manipulation, and
 first-person shooters. So, to minimize travel between mouse and
 keyboard, functions of the mouse and the mouse-hand side of the
 keyboard should overlap as much as possible. These probably include:
 motion and selection.</li>
  <li>I&rsquo;ll revisit <a href="http://10gui.com/">10/GUI</a> again, for some of the
 fantastic insights therein:
    <ul>
      <li>Single axis of windows (Con10uum).</li>
      <li>Different levels of interaction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Direct manipulation interfaces suggest that cursors are unnecessary.
 In our thought experiment, they would probably exist only in certain
 applications, specifically mouse-based ones.</li>
  <li>We can draw inspiration from keyboard-only UIs.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> is a venerable text editor that I&rsquo;ve
recently converted to. Its interface is modal, and its main mode
of operation is through a command-based console.</li>
      <li>Windows&rsquo; keyboard access of menus, with visual indicators.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="fresh-start">Fresh Start</h3>

<p>My initial idea doesn&rsquo;t stray too far from traditional WIMP systems.
We&rsquo;ll retain the windows, icons, and menus, but relegate the pointing
device to only when necessary or appropriate. Let&rsquo;s start with windows:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll steal Con10uum&rsquo;s single axis for windows with no allowance for
vertical resizing, since I agree that the extra axis really only adds to
the clutter and complexity.</p>

<p>Without a cursor, we navigate by using four directional keys on the
keyboard, which I&rsquo;ll just call [left], [right], [up], and [down], to
select and highlight whole objects e.g. windows, more like navigating
console game menus:</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqf42q0BC81qzvz3x.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>In this single axis system, z-order is really the same as horizontal
order. So we&rsquo;ll use z-order in a different way, by adding nested
elements, and two more directional keys: [in] and [out].</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqf47kWy801qzvz3x.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With any element selected in the UI, we can hit [menu] to invoke a
consistent menu of possible actions to take on the element, with a
corresponding key or sequence of keys for each action.</p>

<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lqf47yVuVp1qzvz3x.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>This makes possible command sequences that can become unconscious,
relegated to muscle memory in the same way typing words can be. It makes
movement sequences equally unconscious, as any Vim user will tell you.
The benefits of making these into unconscious processes are many. Not
only are they potentially faster and less interruptive to cognitive
flow, but they can accumulate in a way that analog pointer-based UIs
cannot. Once you learn the sequence for a particular menu command and
use it enough to internalize it, you no longer have to think about it
and can then spend that cognition on learning a new sequence. Learning
to use the interface becomes an almost linguistic exercise.
Pointer-based UIs can never reach this level because every action, every
invocation of a menu or icon is a conscious act that demands much more
attention.</p>

<p>Vim gives us other directions to explore with a primarily
keyboard-driven interface. The basic principles of fewest number of key
presses and proximity to the home row keys seem like good ones. Also,
shortcuts to specific locations, e.g. the [os] key would take you
directly to the operating system level and the [application] key to the
application level. We can also take Vim&rsquo;s concept of iteration, so [5],
[left] would take you left five times. While Vim lives on the far end of
a brutal learning curve, it&rsquo;s a rich source of insight into how powerful
a user interface can be when discoverability and intuitiveness are cast
aside.</p>

<p>Starting with a high-bandwidth interaction model at the OS level has the
added benefit of leaving fewer UI decisions to applications. A user can
access more actions through a consistent menu/key sequence throughout
the system, obviating the need to learn new keyboard shortcuts and
interactions for each new application.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-just-a-rough-draft-of-an-idea">This is just a rough draft of an idea.</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s an attempt to start thinking in ways unbound by the conventions
we&rsquo;ve been living with for decades. I imagine there are many different
directions one can take, starting from the new assumptions we are
allowed post-mouse.</p>

<p>The implications of a system like this are probably too big to patch
onto the systems we have now. There would be a keyboard-driven interface
analog to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts's_law">Fitts&rsquo;s Law</a> that
would have implications for application design as well as operating
system design. E.g. an application designer would always want to
minimize the number of key presses it would take to move from any
location to any other location, which would require a careful balance
between breadth and depth of element distribution.</p>

<p>Anything in the near future will probably have to look a lot more like
what we already have, and be filled with the compromises that we see in
Lion and early demonstrations of Windows 8. But recent advancements
provide us with a new context in which to fundamentally reconsider human
computer interaction. There&rsquo;s never been a time when it was more
possible to try something truly new, or to more significantly change the
landscape of future computing. My fear is that the trend toward simpler,
more tightly controlled, narrower user experiences optimized for passive
consumption will dominate. My hope is that we use the opportunity to
create user experiences that encourage more active consumption, more
substantial production, a generally richer, denser,

      <p>Arthur C. Clark famously
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws">said</a>: &ldquo;Any
sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&rdquo;
An abstract description of how this works is that a new technology
is initially simple, then accumulates additional functionality. As
its functionality grows, its operation becomes more complex. It then
requires a more expert user to take advantage of the added
functionality. But after a certain point, further advancements
address this complexity of operation by internalizing it. This makes
the technology simple to use for lay users, but in an opaque,
‘magical&rsquo; way. <a href="#fnref:1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>The mapping between iOS&rsquo;s direct manipulation and Lion&rsquo;s indirect
manipulation via touchpad is weird. Nothing in iOS maps to moving
the cursor around by dragging your finger across the touchpad.
Scrolling with one finger in iOS, maps to dragging with two fingers
in Lion. Touching in iOS maps to pressing down harder on the part of
the touchpad that you&rsquo;re already touching in Lion. And that&rsquo;s not
even getting into the crazy gestures. I think this actually produces
a UI &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley">uncanny valley</a>&rdquo;

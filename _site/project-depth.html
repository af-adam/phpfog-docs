<h2>Project: Depth</h2>
<p><date datetime="Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 -0700 2011">June 14, 2011</date><p>
	</div>
<p>I don&rsquo;t particularly enjoy traditional social settings like bars or
parties. Partly this is because I can&rsquo;t hear very well, especially when
there&rsquo;s a lot of background noise. But probably a more important reason
is that I feel like a lot of the conversation that happens in these
settings isn&rsquo;t productive. Not productive in the sense of making me
money or advancing civilization, but in the sense of making us
understand each other better on a more than superficial level, or in the
sense of enlightening us or engaging us to some significant depth. From
my perspective, most of the idle chatter that happens in these settings
are basically overhead. Not all of it. And I understand that some people
prefer superficial conversation, so it&rsquo;s not overhead for them. Some
people enjoy eating bread by itself; to me, bread is for holding meat.</p>

<p>I prefer and seek depth in my endeavors. I&rsquo;m starting to think it&rsquo;s my
overarching project. I think it&rsquo;s what all my various little projects
have been about: Breakfast, the various incarnations of Since the War,
the party chat, NMBC, EMDN, and now EMSN.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> It&rsquo;s also what
motivates my thoughts on social networks, browsers, etc, as well as on
user interfaces and the rationality engine.</p>

<p>Depth is my project.</p>

<p>And since this blog is basically a brain-dump, and that&rsquo;s what I spend
most of my idle cycles on, I guess that&rsquo;s mostly what this blog&rsquo;s about.</p>

<p>There are two separate vectors of depth that I think about:</p>

<h3 id="there-are-oceans-to-explore-but-we-stay-in-puddles">There are oceans to explore, but we stay in puddles.</h3>

<p>The problem of the proliferation of shallow communication is more
fundamental than the implementation of currently popular social
networks. I&rsquo;m starting to see it as three parts:</p>

<h3 id="look-forward-not-backward-upward-not-forward">Look forward, not backward; upward, not forward.</h3>

<p>There are huge, Lovecraftian commercial forces at work, with a vested
interest in keeping our attention spans short, and our feedback loops
shorter. These forces feed on &lsquo;eyeballs&rsquo; and &lsquo;clicks&rsquo; and measure us in
aggregate. It seems unlikely that we can change that.</p>

<p>But there are countervailing forces. Some commercial ones, like
<a href="http://flickr.com">Flickr</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com/">Stack
Exchange</a>,<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> harness the power of
communities to dig deep mines of richness on the web. Others are
non-commercial, like Wikipedia. Many come from people scratching their
own itches: <a href="https://www.readability.com/">Readability</a> and
<a href="http://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>, made by and for people who
wanted to be able to read web writing without the now conventional
distractions of modern web design; any number of anti-procrastination
applications that block your internet connection for specified periods
of time to improve task focus; and services like
<a href="http://longform.org/">longform.org</a> and
<a href="http://delivereads.com/">delivereads</a> that encourage deep reading of
long form journalism. Physical devices that enable depth are becoming
wildly popular: the Kindle is an obvious example, as is the iPad, which,
despite <a href="http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/5442955515/holding-the-web-in-your-hands">my
misgivings</a>,
enables an unprecedented immersion experience by presenting an intuitive
and emotionally satisfying interaction model. And of course there are
<a href="http://cognitivesocialweb.com/home/2011/6/7/on-the-purpose-and-the-engine-of-the-web.html">others</a>
thinking about the same problems.</p>

<p>We are all naturally insular to some degree. We are all anxious,
novelty-seeking apes. We are buoyant, in the working metaphor. And there
are two ways to dive deeper: learn to hold our breath longer; and make
tools to so we don&rsquo;t have to. Can&rsquo;t hurt to try both.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;m not trying to take all the credit for all of these, just

    <li id="fn:4">
      <p>Probably not deep on either of the vectors I&rsquo;ve enumerated, but
Stack Exchange was built as a direct response to the shallow
cesspool of technical knowledge that was available on the internet.
It maybe represents a third vector: depth of information?<a href="#fnref:4" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

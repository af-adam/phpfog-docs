<p>All applications by default have only read access to the files and folders in your application.</p>

<p>To make a folder or file writable, use the &ldquo;Permission&rdquo; tab in the App console to specific the paths of the filers/folders which are to be writable.</p>

<p>Note: Git doesn&rsquo;t create folders if they are empty, and therefore changing permissions will not work. First you follow the instructions in &ldquo;How do I create a folder in git?.&rdquo; After you complete this you can use the permissions tool to make it writable as needed.</p>

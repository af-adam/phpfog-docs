<p>By default, all apps have only read access to files and directories. </p>

<p>To add write permissions to a file or directory:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to your PHP Fog app console. </li>
  <li>Click on the &ldquo;Permissions&rdquo; tab on the left. </li>
  <li>Enter the path to the file or directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note: Git doesn&rsquo;t create empty folders, so setting permissions on an empty folder might not work. If you run into this problem, simply add a dummy file into the directory you&rsquo;re trying to create. </p>

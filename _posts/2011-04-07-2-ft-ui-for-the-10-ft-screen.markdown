title: The 2-Foot User Interface for the 10-Foot Screen
layout: post
---


Television user interfaces could be so much better. I thought that with
the introduction of set-top box internet video solutions, user
interfaces would make menu and playback navigation and content
management easier, especially now that we have ways to interact with
these boxes using our smartphones.[^1] If anyone, I thought
Apple--with their customary attention to user experience and their
vertical integration--would have an elegant solution to interaction with
TVs. But when I hooked up our new Apple TV2[^2] and tested out
the remote application on the iPod Touch and the iPad, all I got was a
simulation of the physical remote control.[^3] Everything else
I've tried is pretty much the same, to include: Boxee and Windows Media
Center (couldn't even actually find an Android or iOS app to work with
this, unsurprisingly).

### The 10-Foot User Interface

Used to be that all you needed was a few buttons on your remote: power
toggle, channel up and down, volume up and down; plus some optionals:
numbers 0â€“9, mute toggle, channel recall, etc. Once you got used to it,
you didn't even need to look at the remote, which was nice. But as
television sets became more complex, with more options, settings, and
configurations, remotes got loaded with more buttons. Peripheral devices
added even more buttons, usually on a separate remote, which you could
integrate into a single universal remote if you wanted to and had the
technological wherewithal to do so.

At first, with simple sets, this really was fine. And even as TVs got
more complicated and loaded with more functionality, you still needed a
way to control all the additional functionality. There wasn't any other
place for this than the remote and there wasn't any way to do it on the
remote without adding buttons.

Meanwhile, from the other direction, desktop computer interfaces were
simplified and enlarged for use on the TV screen (from 10 feet away).
Window management was (naturally) discarded for a simple environment
optimized for doing one thing: watching video.

As these two TV paradigms converge in devices like the Apple
TV,[^4] Boxee Box, and Google TV, as well as in TVs themselves,
the functionality starts to overwhelm the UI bandwidth: UI elements
increasingly clutter up and obscure the screen, menu hierarchies become
deeper and more complicated, and the fact is that a TV is not a computer
monitor and it sucks to do computer monitor things on a TV
screen.[^5]

### Reboot

No one's really been in a position to be able to rethink TV UI until
very recently. Even now, one cannot make the assumption that a TV
watcher has a peripheral with which to interact with the TV[^6],
so the system designers still have to provide an on-screen UI by
default.

But I think it's getting closer. Watching TV with a laptop, tablet, or
smartphone in hand is becoming more popular, as people idly multitask,
google, or participate in social media as they watch.[^7] And if
you take it for granted that your user has a secondary screen, you can
start to really change the way TV UI works.

As a starting point, you could relegate all UI elements to the secondary
screen, leaving the primary screen completely over to what it's
specifically designed for: playing video. The secondary screen,
meanwhile, because it's a 2-foot or 1-foot UI device, can present a lot
more information, and present navigation that is faster, more
informationally dense, granular, and intuitive than the on-screen
navigations that we're used to.

You could also add more features, like playlists or queues,[^8]
app integration,[^9] games, and multiple video
streams.[^10]

### Notes

[^1]: And iPod Touches. 

[^2]: Bev got me one for Valentine's Day.
    

[^3]: At least text entry was much easier; hitting a text field would
    invoke the touch screen keyboard.
    

[^4]: The ATV isn't actually a convergence device, since it doesn't take
    input from traditional signals like analog broadcast, cable, or
    peripheral physical media players, but it sort of will be if IPTV
    ever becomes a reality. 

[^5]: This is why WebTV failed, or at least why it sucked.
    

[^6]: Obviously because not everyone has one and shipping an iPod Touch
    equivalent as a remote is certainly cost-prohibitive.
    

[^7]: Also, some high-end universal remotes cost as much as iPod Touches.
    

[^8]: Which becomes more important as short web clips become a ubiquitous,
    first-class medium. 

[^9]: Twitter with automatic hashtags for whatever you're watching?
    

[^10]: Like picture-in-picture, but more robust.

I'm reading through [A Supposedly Fun
Blog](http://asupposedlyfunblog.wordpress.com/) and ran across [this
passage](http://asupposedlyfunblog.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/on-beauty/):

> â€¦all of this, the aggrieved and distrustful critical reaction to any
> novel that comes within a quarter mile of what we might call the
> postmodern, has been established for years. It was well established, I
> mean to say, when David Foster Wallace wrote Infinite Jest. Which
> means that he, like all authors today, wrote in the knowledge that the
> literary world would be filled with exactly those kinds of readers and
> critics who would dismiss his work out of hand for its artiness and
> pretension. And yet Foster Wallace wrote on, like a lot of writers do,
> in the stubborn belief in the good faith of his audience.

(which is actually a blockquote from
[here](http://www.ordinary-gentlemen.com/2009/07/a-few-thoughts-on-a-supposedly-fun-blog/))

And it really speaks to what I love about DFW, because it's not like he
was without fear of being judged. It seems clear from his writing that
he was actually extraordinarily, excruciatingly self-conscious about it
all, but he did trek on.

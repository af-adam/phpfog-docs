In [this post on
Cyborgology](http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2011/11/03/equipment-why-you-cant-convince-a-cyborg-shes-a-cyborg/),
PJ Rey convincingly speaks to the project of dismissing the concept of
digital dualism. He argues that as technology becomes sufficiently
advanced and ubiquitous, we begin to think of it as natural extensions
of ourselves.

Rings true for me. But more than anything else it emphasizes the
importance of thinking carefully about the ways in which we are
extending ourselves.

Noam Chomsky
[provoked](http://www.brightestyoungthings.com/articles/the-secret-of-noam-a-chomsky-interview.htm)
a great discussion in the last few weeks by offhandedly dismissing new
media as "extremely rapid, very shallow communication." Nathan Jurgenson
[responded in a piece in
Salon](http://www.salon.com/2011/10/23/why_chomsky_is_wrong_about_twitter/singleton/),
talking about the great benefits of new media, e.g. its utility in
popular movements like the Arab Spring and "Occupy" protests, as well as
the biases inherent in Chomsky's somewhat crotchety dismissal.

But ultimately I agree most with [this

by Mike Plugh.

Both posts are entirely worth reading.

I take from this discussion that not only do different digital tools
have different strengths and weaknesses for different activities, but
they each encourage certain types of behavior. To quote
[myself](http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/3112676038/the-end-of-comments):

[And the web itself sometimes seems inimical to depth of
thought](http://blog.byjoemoon.com/post/6542036868/project-depth).

That we are subsuming technologies into ourselves seems trivial compared
to the point that what we are subsuming encourage us to think only in a
certain way. If we examine carefully what we are becoming, I don't think
we'll like what we find.

And some, like [Nicholas
Carr](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/6868/),
have already, and they don't like what they find at all. He, and,
presumably, Chomsky, would advocate, then, a retreat back to the old
media. Full-length books are what encourage the deep, sustained
concentration necessary for truly worthwhile thought. I think "Digital
Fasting" movements (restrictions of internet/screen time) also stem from
a sentiment that these technologies are having a pernicious effect on
us.

But a retreat to old media can't be the correct answer. Not only because
of the limits of physical media--like relegation to passive consumption
and the lack of communal experience--but also because the old media have
assumptions of their own built in that are just as pernicious. There is
an authoritarian centralization of power inherent to the old publishing
model, for example, as well as limited viable formats. Ideas of a
certain size, too long for long-form, but too short for full-length
books, simply had no way to exist in old media. They had to either be
cut down or inflated to fill viable formats.

New media have no such restrictions. In fact, our new digital tools are
the most versatile, plastic, and accessible that we've ever had. We
should be honest and clear about what our tools are doing to us. But we
should then focus our energy on creating the tools that we want, instead
of trying to stop the inexorable tide of change.

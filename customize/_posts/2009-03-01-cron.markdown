Sometimes you need to run a task periodically. You can do that quickly and easily on PHP Fog Dedicated Clouds with Cron Jobs. 

Running cron jobs is dead simple. Just create a php file with the script you want to run and place it somewhere in your app. 

Then go to your PHP Fog app console and click on the "Cron Jobs" tab.

Set the path to your script in the "Command Path" field and pick your schedule. 

<img class="screenshot" src="/img/screenshots/cron-2.jpg" alt="Cron Jobs"/>

Hit "Save Changes" and you're done!

### Frameworks

For frameworks like Drupal, there's one more step. Because the cron jobs run as if executed from the shell, the framework environment isn't loaded. 

To work around this, you can have your cron job simply make an external HTTP request to run the actual code. Here's how: 

<ol>
<li>Create another file called <code>"/<your cron job 2/>.php"</code> and add the following line to it: </li>
</ol>

{: .prettyprint}
    <?php file_get_contents('http://<your app url>/<cron script>');

<ol start="2">
<li>Change the "Command Path" in your app console to "<code><your cron job 2>.php</code>". </li>
</ol>

PHP Fog provides logging by interacting with the third-party log hosting service Logentries.

### Install Logging

To install logging with Logentries, just go to [this page](https://logentries.com/doc/phpfog/) and create an account with your email address. Copy the secret token that appears.

Then go to your PHP Fog app console and click on the "Logs" tab on the left. Click on the "Setup" button for Logentries, enter your secret token, and hit "Save and Activate".

That's it! Pretty soon, you should see your logs rolling into your Logentries dashboard.

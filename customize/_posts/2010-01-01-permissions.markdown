By default, all PHP Fog apps have only read access to files and directories. To add write permissions to a file or directory:

1. Go to your PHP Fog app console. 

2. Click on the "Permissions" tab on the left. 

3. Enter the path to the file or directory.

Note: Git doesn't create empty folders, so setting permissions on an empty folder might not work. If you run into this problem, simply add a dummy file into the directory you want to create.

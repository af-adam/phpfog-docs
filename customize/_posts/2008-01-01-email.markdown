### Client Email

PHP Fog doesn't offer email as a service directly, but we set up integration with GMail by default, so you can easily use Google Apps to host your email. [Click here](https://www.google.com/a/cpanel/domain/new) to get started setting up GMail for your custom domain name. The DNS records for PHP Fog apps are already configured. 

### App Email

PHP Fog supports PHP's `mail()` method. Each dedicated instance has an SMTP server so you can send email just as you would from any PHP application. The server can send around 35 emails per second. 

This method is not, however, the best method for sending email because it doesn't provide the greatest reliability, throughput, or visibility.

Fortunately, we have great third-party add-ons and services that are simple to set up and operate, address all of `mail()`'s shortcomings, and provide robust additional functionality:

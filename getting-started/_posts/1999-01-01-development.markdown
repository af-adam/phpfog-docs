Now that you can push code to and from your app, you'll want to set up a local development environment before doing anything serious. Setting up a local environment allows you to shorten the feedback loop on your development process. It also keeps all of your code in git, which makes it easy to roll back changes and makes your app easily scalable. 

### 1. Set up your local environment.

###### Mac OSX

<ol>
<li type="a">Download and install [MAMP](http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html).</li>
<li type="a">TKTKTK</li>
</ol>

###### Linux

###### Windows

<ol>
<li type="a">Download and install [XAMPP]().</li>
<li type="a">TKTKTK</li>
</ol>

### 2. Create environment variables.

After you have your local environment set up, you'll want to be able to deploy the same code in both your local environment and your live remote server. In order to do this, you'll want to set up many of your configuration in environment variables.

<ol>
<li type="a">Local</li>
<li type="a">PHP Fog app console</li>
</ol>

When you first create your app, PHP Fog sets up your MySQL Database credentials for you. Instead of hard-coding these credentials into your app, PHP Fog creates a set of environment variables and stores your credentials there. 

To access these credentials in your app, simply call these environment variables using the `getenv()` function. You can find these environment variables and the actual credential values in your PHP Fog app console under the "Env. Variables" tab. 

Here's an example of how to access your environment variables:

    <?php
    // Example use of getenv()
    $ip = getenv('MYSQL_DB_HOST');
    ?>

These environment variables also make it easy for you to [set up your development environment](/getting-started/development).

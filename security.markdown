The entire PHP Fog environment is secured at every layer. 

#### Dedicated

PHP Fog apps on a Dedicated Cloud run on dedicated servers. Only your apps run on those dedicated servers. 

At the system level, access is limited to allow only our software agents and staff members. This is strictly enforced by our security and firewall policies. Every app is guaranteed to be on a server tied to your account. 

Network access is also limited by security and firewall policies and access is strictly monitored. Your code, files, and credentials are only accessible by our software agents and staff members. 

You have full control over what files and directories to make accessible in your public web directory.

#### Shared

In our Shared environment, we've taken a more cautious approach to security. System functions and functions that can potentially be abused have been disabled. Check out our [FAQ](/faqs#sharedvdedicated) for more on the limitations of the Shared Cloud.

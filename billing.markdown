PHP Fog bills on a monthly schedule and prorates your initial bill from the day you upgrade to the end of the month.

### I just upgraded from Shared to a Dedicated Cloud. How will I be billed? 

If you upgrade to a Silver Cloud on the April 15th, we'll charge you $14.50 (50%) when you upgrade.

### If I run one server all month and I want to scale up for a day, how will I be billed? 

We'll charge you the prorated amount for the rest of the month, then credit your account the prorated amount when you scale back.

So if you run one server on a Silver Cloud at $29 for the whole month, but add four more servers for just one day, then you'll end up paying an additional $3.87 that month. When you first scale up you'll be charged 4 &times; $29 prorated for the month (remaining days in the month / total days in the month). When you scale back the next day, you'll be credited the remainder using the same calculation, leaving you with an extra charge of $3.87. 

We charge in 24 hour increments, so even if you use a server for only 2 hours in a day, you'll be charged for the full 24 hours.

### My card expired or I haven't provided a payment for a paid service yet. What's going to happen? 

If the payment for a service is invalid, we'll continue to provide service for 10 days after the billing due date. During this 10-day grace period:

* You'll continue to accrue charges.
* You won't be able to subscribe to new services.
* Your access to source code will be restricted to read-only.
* Your app console will notify you that your bill is overdue.
* Our automated system will notify you daily by email that your bill is overdue.

After this 10-day grace period, the account will be terminated and the contents deleted. Please be aware that these files are *not* recoverable! If you receive an overdue bill notification, please update your credit card information in your account settings as soon as possible.
